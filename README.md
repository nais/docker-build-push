# nais/docker-build-push

This action contains recommended steps for building and publishing a Docker image used with the NAIS platform.

It will authenticate with the registry and build the image, named after the repository, and use a generated tag containing the timestamp and short commit hash.

If you need to build multiple images from the same repository, you can use the `image_suffix` input to add a suffix to the image name.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_push:
    permissions:
      contents: "read"
      id-token: "write"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: nais/docker-build-push@v0
        id: docker-push
        with:
          team: myteam # required
          tag: custom_tag # optional
          push_image: true # optional, default true
          pull: true # optional, default false
          dockerfile: Dockerfile # optional, default Dockerfile
          docker_context: . # optional, default .
          image_suffix: # optional, default empty
          cache_from: type=gha # optional, default type=gha
          cache_to: type=gha,mode=max # optional, default type=gha,mode=max
          build_args: | # optional, default empty
            FOO=bar
            BAZ=qux
          build_secrets:
            | # optional, default empty. See https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/secrets/
            key=string
          target: runtime # optional, default empty
          project_id: ${{ vars.NAIS_MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID }} # required, but is defined as an organization variable
          identity_provider: ${{ secrets.NAIS_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }} # required, but is defined as an organization secret
          salsa: true # optional, default true, generates a attestation for the image
          byosbom: # defaults to use Trivy for SBOM generation, if salsa is true, but can be overwritten sending in a path to a  pre-generated SBOM
          platforms: # optional, pass trough to docker/build-push-action. See https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#usage. Requires setup-qemu-action, https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action#usage
      - name: Deploy
        uses: nais/deploy/actions/deploy@v1
        env:
          # ...
          IMAGE: ${{ steps.docker-push.outputs.image }}
```

## Dependency

This action depends on [nais/login](https://github.com/nais/login) to authenticate with the registry and [nais/attest-sign](https://github.com/nais/attest-sign) to add some [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/).

## Known issues

### Overwriting environment variables

When using this action in a job that also uses [navikt/frontend/actions/cdn-upload](https://github.com/navikt/frontend/tree/main/actions/cdn-upload/v1), you will get warnings that the latter of the two is overwriting multiple environment variables.

The two actions will both authenticate to Google Cloud, but with different service accounts and possibly project IDs.

The known solution is to split the job into two separate jobs.

### Long repo names or long branch names

`The size of mapped attribute exceeds the 127 bytes limit.`

When using [Google Workload-identity-federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) we map attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as `google.subject`.
`google.subject` is the principal IAM is authenticating and cannot exceed 127 bytes.
The error typically happens if you have a long branch name, or a long repo name.
Referring to this issue: https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#subject-exceeds-the-127-byte-limit

### SLSA

This action [signs](https://doc.nais.io/security/salsa/salsa/?h=slsa#what-is-slsa) the image so that its integrity can be verified by anyone wanting to use it. A "Software Bill Of Materials" is also automatically generated unless you bring your own. This happens "keylessly" behind the scenes, and the signatures are uploaded to the public [transparency log](https://search.sigstore.dev/).
